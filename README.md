This project is a game written by python and pygame that allows the space ship to shoot the aliens.

What we are supposed to create, is a game that includes one player, which is shown as a spaceship in the game There is going to be a group of aliens, alinged in a group, and they are the enemies that we will need to kill. The spaceship have some bullets that could be shooted out, and these bullets could kill the aliens. There are also several GUI and some other resitrictions in the game that we will need to implement in order for it to be working correctly.

The code itself contains around 1000 lines of code, and they are broken up into several different modules, such as the wave, which is to control each wave of aliens, the model class, which is the basic settings for the spaceship, alliens and the bullets. Finally there is also an app module, which is the general controller of the application.
