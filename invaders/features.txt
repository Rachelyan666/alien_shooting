2. I display the player scores and player life number on the top of the screen. I created two new attributes in the class Wave, and initialize them at first. I add the score when detecting whether the alien was hit by the bolt. I change the life number when the animation of ship explosion is over. The score of alien decrease from the front rows to the back rows.
3. I change the fonts, font size, and the background of the game. For fonts and font sizes, I put the constants in the Glable object. For the background, I included a new attribute in the class of Invaders for the background.
